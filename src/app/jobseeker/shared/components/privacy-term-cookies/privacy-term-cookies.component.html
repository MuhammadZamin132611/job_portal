            <p>Jobcheck.in occasionally advertises on third party websites. As part of our effort to track the
                success
                of
                our advertising campaigns, we may at times use a visitor identification technology such as "web
                beacons," or
                "action tags," which count visitors who have come to our site after being exposed to a Jobcheck.in
                banner ad
                on a third-party site. Our partners may also use web beacons to collect data in the aggregate as
                provided by
                your browser while you are on our site or another site where Jobcheck.in is third party.</p>
